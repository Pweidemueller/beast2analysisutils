# Welcome to beast2analysisutils

A miscellaneous collection of analysis utilities that I frequently use in the BEAST2 ecosystem.

Broadly there are two types of analysis currently in this package:
1. Using ReMASTER output to construct BEAST2 XML files from templates by inserting simulated trees and/or sequences.
2. Calculating the effective sample sizes (ESS) for all parameters in a BEAST2 log file.

## Installation

```bash
pip install beast2analysisutils
```

## Usage

See the [Reference](reference.md) page for API details.
